# Sprint 1 - 09 - #include

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: Chaney, Michael

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint#.md).

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* Someone else approves and merges commits, you may not merge your own changes.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* #28 Tripco: The Application server should identify the client and server in use.
* #29 Tripco: USe a standard logging system on the server.
* #30 User: I'd like to know who to thank for the tool.
* #31 User: I'd like to compute the distance between two location on the planet.
* #48 User: I'd like to know where I am in the map
* #32 USer: I may need distance in other units.


## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* #28 Tripco: The Application server should identify the client and server in use.
* #29 Tripco: USe a standard logging system on the server.
* #30 User: I'd like to know who to thank for the tool.
* #31 User: I'd like to compute the distance between two location on the planet.

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* #48 User: I'd like to know where I am in the map. We got very close, but ran into a problem with our understanding of understanding of how callbacks worked, little additional time is needed to better research and complete this epic
* #32 USer: I may need distance in other units. Lack of time to complete

#### What went well
* In class meetings
* About page
* Asking for help when we were having problems
* Github manangment, handling pull requests quickly

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Lack of experience with JavaScript
* Lack of understanding with how the system worked

## Retrospective

#### What went well
How we were working as a team worked very well, we communicated efficiently. We found a great meeting location right across the street from the stadium in one of our member's apartment complex. 
#### Potential improvements
  We can mix up what parts of the system we're working on, this sprint the 2 working on server worked alsmost exclusivly on server and vice versa. 
#### What we will change next time
  As we have more tasks to complete, we will work to mix up what part of the code each teammate works on.
